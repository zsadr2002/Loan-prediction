# Loan Default Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project analyzes a loan dataset to predict whether a loan will default or not using Logistic Regression. It demonstrates essential steps in a data science pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset
- File: `loan.csv`
- Contains information on loan applicants, including features like credit history, income, loan amount, and target variable (`Loan_Status`).

## 🧠 Objective
To predict loan approval status using logistic regression, and evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib

## 🔍 Steps Covered
1. Import libraries and load dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Train/test split
5. Build logistic regression model
6. Evaluate model performance
7. Visualize feature importance and results

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: 100 %
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report provided
- Insights support understanding of approval criteria for loans

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-default-prediction.git
cd loan-default-prediction
jupyter notebook Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb
```
